# foodlog

A primitive web app to log food consumption.

The app is under development.  The plumbing is generally in place, but there are some essential TODO items:

* Decide how to represent dates and times and apply appropriate validation.
* Implement a real data store.  The current one just keeps a list in memory.
* Implement a web socket heartbeat.

Other desirables are:

* Typeahead recommendations for food based on existing foods.
* Database of food nutrition information.
* Reports of nutritions per day.
* Fancy stuff I would never use.
